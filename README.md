# SnipShot

SnipShot is a stylish code snippet uploader that leverages API technology to format and beautify code snippets. The app uses Pinata for secure, decentralized storage of all generated snippet images, ensuring users can easily store and share their creations

This project was built using modern technologies, including React, Vite, TypeScript, Material-UI for the user interface, and hosted with Vercel for seamless deployment

## Getting Started

To run SnipShot locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn as the package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mitchiemt11/codescan.git
   cd codescan
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## Pinata Integration

SnipShot leverages Pinata for secure and decentralized storage of snippet images. All images generated by users are stored on Pinata's IPFS, making them easily retrievable and securely stored.

### Steps to Integrate Pinata

To integrate Pinata into your local environment:

1. Sign up for a Pinata account at [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/).
2. Generate an API Key from your Pinata dashboard.
3. Add your Pinata API Key and Pinata Secret Key to the `.env.local` file.

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
   PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key
   ```

All image uploads will now be routed through Pinata for secure storage on the decentralized IPFS network.

## Environment Variables

To run SnipShot, you will need to set up environment variables. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key
```

Replace the placeholders with the respective values for your Pinata configuration.

## Running Locally
